🧠 LSTM Word Predictor
📌 Project Overview

LSTM Word Predictor is a Deep Learning based Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that predicts the next word in a sentence using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The model learns contextual and sequential relationships between words to generate accurate next-word predictions.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of sequence modeling and language modeling using deep learning techniques.

🚀 Features

Next word prediction using LSTM

Text preprocessing (tokenization & padding)

Sequence generation

Trained neural network model

Context-aware word prediction

Simple and interactive prediction interface

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

NLP Techniques

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network

⚙️ How It Works

Text data is collected and cleaned.

Sentences are tokenized into sequences.

Input sequences are padded to maintain uniform length.

LSTM model is trained to predict the next word.

The trained model generates predictions based on user input text.

📊 Model Architecture

Embedding Layer

LSTM Layer

Dense Output Layer (Softmax Activation)

The LSTM layer helps capture long-term dependencies in text data, making predictions more context-aware and meaningful.
